# Builds the repository_dispatch JSON payload for a plugin release, reading
# NAME, DESC, REPO, VERSION, TAG (required) and CHANGELOG (optional) from
# the environment and printing the JSON to stdout. Exits 1 if a required
# variable is empty or unset.
#
# `changelog` is added to client_payload only when CHANGELOG is non-empty --
# this keeps the payload at or under the repository_dispatch 10-key limit
# and matches the #5 first-release case (no previous tag, no changelog).
#
# CHANGELOG is passed through byte-for-byte: no trimming of leading or
# trailing whitespace/newlines happens here (the sentinel-based trailing-
# newline strip on the release body happens once, earlier, in release.yml's
# Dispatch step -- never again in this script).
#
# See .adev/9-1/plan.md (R3) for the full contract.

# On native-Windows jq (as shipped on windows-latest runners), reading
# non-ASCII bytes back out of the environment via jq's own `$ENV` mangles
# them (jq's Windows build reads the process environment through the
# narrow/ANSI API, not UTF-8 -- verified empirically: a "u+umlaut" and an
# emoji both come back as the replacement character). Passing every value
# as a `--arg` instead keeps it on the argv path, which git-bash hands to
# jq.exe with the bytes intact. MSYS_NO_PATHCONV / MSYS2_*_CONV_EXCL stop
# git-bash from rewriting any argv value that merely looks like a Unix path
# (e.g. a changelog line containing "/usr/bin:/tmp") before jq ever sees it.
